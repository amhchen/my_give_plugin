The source code I based this off of is found at https://github.com/WordImpress/Give

I did a major overhaul and added many new features to the original code to suit the needs of the organization I worked for in the summer of 2016. The initial commit is haphazard and has little documentation because I was rushing to release. I created the repository halfway through development.
In the following weeks I started to clean it up, while continuing to add little things here and there.
